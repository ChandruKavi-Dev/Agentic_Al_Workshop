Unlike traditional AI which focuses on executing specific tasks, Agentic AI systems possess a degree of autonomy, learning, planning, and adaptation.  They can perceive their environment, make decisions, and act upon those decisions to achieve pre-defined or learned objectives.

An Agentic AI, however, would perceive the room's state, plan its cleaning route based on obstacles and priorities, and adapt its actions if it encounters unexpected clutter.\"\n",
